        <p>Merry Christmas to all of our friends &amp; family! We&rsquo;d bet our picture is under a magnet on your refrigerator, but go ahead and frame it &amp; put it on your mantle if it hasn&rsquo;t already made it in your trashcan&hellip; ðŸ˜‰ Regardless, we sent you a card because we care about and are grateful for you, and value our relationship with you. If you&rsquo;ve made it this far, thanks for reading along!</p><p>Welcome to our Standridge Family 1-time &ldquo;newsletter.&rdquo; We want to share how God has been good to us in 2023. Like everyone, we&rsquo;ve had our ups and there have been downs. Our little 23-month-old Solo keeps us on our toes but he&rsquo;s also our biggest cuddle bug. Lily, on the other hand, is a clone of her mother. If you don&rsquo;t follow the routine&mdash;as she sees it&mdash;she will <strong>emphatically</strong> tell you. Deep down, both mom and dad are proud of that.</p><p>This year has included some vocational change &ndash; Callie started working part-time at our home church, <a href='https://churchonthemove.com' target='_blank'>Church on the Move</a>. It&rsquo;s been a blessing to our family and she&rsquo;s enjoyed having another opportunity to effectively use her gifts. We are also thankful both of the kids are enrolled in the Guts (church) <a href='https://gutschurch.com/early-learning-program/' target='_blank'>Early Learning Program</a>, where they attend 3 days a week. This has enabled Callie to work while also providing them a safe, Godly environment to learn, have fun, and grow.</p><p>Alongside all the vocational and childcare changes this year, Callie has been seeing a functional medicine doctor for about 18 months, with the hope of identifying the root of some long-held health issues. During this last 1.5 years it&rsquo;s been, at times, very difficult. The tests and treatments would&mdash;more often than not&mdash;leave us confused, frustrated and discouraged. Under this doctor&rsquo;s care Callie made dramatic changes to her diet and began avoiding all inflammatory foods. It&rsquo;s been difficult amidst having toddlers and when the hoped-for change wasn&rsquo;t seemingly leading to healing, we&rsquo;d been left feeling somewhat hopeless.</p><p><em>But God</em>. Around Halloween, Callie <strong>finally</strong> showed some progress when she went in for an appointment. Though on the verge of moving on to other treatments/doctors/etc, she felt led to pray boldly over this particular visit. Together, she and Grant prayed for a couple of things:</p><ol><li>That she would get a <strong>clarifying</strong> answer &ndash; no confusion around what had been going on physically in her body.</li><li>That the treatment (plan) would be conducive to our life as a family</li></ol><p>God showed up at that appointment when Callie&rsquo;s doctor walked in and said they&rsquo;d found the answer for why she&rsquo;d been feeling so badly. And the prescribed treatment plan to resolve it is incredibly easy! There would be no &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; lifestyle changes and she&rsquo;d be able to splurge (a little) on some foods throughout the upcoming holidays without feeling crummy afterward. Callie came home glowing after that appointment not only because of the good news from her doctor, but also because she knew God had <em>heard</em> her and <em>answered</em> her. If you&rsquo;re more curious about her health &ldquo;journey,&rdquo; <a href='mailto:callierstandridge@gmail.com?subject=Curious%20About%20Your%20Health%20Journey%20%E2%80%93%20via%20Christmas%20Card'>ask</a>!</p><p>Our family&rsquo;s Summer started off with a week in beautiful Lake Tahoe as Grant&rsquo;s sister, Kendall, married an amazing guy, Josh. Shortly following the Woodwards&rsquo; wedding week, Solo took his first steps and Lily learned how to swim. We will see if she remembers any of her swimming lessons next Summer&hellip; In August Grant went on his annual <a href='https://mountain.men' target='_blank'>Mountain Men</a> trip to Colorado, where he and a group of like-minded guys who are committed to growing in their faith climb a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteener' target='_blank'>fourteener</a> while backpacking and camping in the backcountry. 2023 was arguably the most impactful trip he&rsquo;d been on for myriad reasons, not the least of which included the group of guys he was with and the depth of discussion that was had around the campfire(s). He could talk about Mountain Men for days&hellip; ðŸ˜‚ If you&rsquo;re curious about it even more, <a href='mailto:grant.standridge@gmail.com?subject=Curious%20About%20Mountain%20Men%20%E2%80%93%20via%20Christmas%20Card'>ask</a>!</p><p>Callie started <a href='https://churchonthemove.com/cotmu' target='_blank'>COTMU</a> in August. It&rsquo;s a 30-week long class at our church that in our church&rsquo;s terms &ldquo;lays a theological foundation for discipleship to Jesus&rdquo;. It has helped her see the Bible a totally different way not only by simply &ldquo;reading it,&rdquo; but also digesting its true meaning, background, history, etc. And we have a pretty cool brother-in-law who happens to be the teacher!</p><p>In summation, it&rsquo;s been a wonderful year and we&rsquo;re thankful for how God has led our steps&mdash;and walked with us&mdash;along the way. We&rsquo;re anticipating all 2024 will bring with it, and we pray you see God&rsquo;s goodness in your lives right where you&rsquo;re at, too.</p><p>&ldquo;May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of His Holy Spirit.&ldquo; &ndash; <a href='https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ROM.15.13.NIV' target='_blank'>Romans 15:13 (NIV)</a></p><p>If you're interested in seeing some <em>additional</em> pictures&mdash;that didn&rsquo;t make the cut for the physical Christmas card&mdash;<span class='cta-label'>tap</span> the button below!<button id='slideshow-btn'>Open Gallery</button></p><p>Although neither Callie nor Grant is too active on Facebook and Instagram, our profile links are below if you&rsquo;re keen to check them out.</p><ul><li><a href='https://www.instagram.com/callierochelle/' target='_blank'>Callie &ndash; Instagram</a></li><li><a href='https://www.instagram.com/grantridgeland/' target='_blank'>Grant &ndash; Instagram</a></li><li><a href='https://www.facebook.com/callie.turner.904' target='_blank'>Callie &ndash; Facebook</a></li><li><a href='https://www.facebook.com/grantridgeland' target='_blank'>Grant &ndash; Facebook</a></li></ul>
