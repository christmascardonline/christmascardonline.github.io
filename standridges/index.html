        <p>Merry Christmas to all of our friends &amp; family! We&rsquo;d bet our picture is under a magnet on your refrigerator, but feel free to frame it and put it on your mantle üòâ If it hasn&rsquo;t already made it in your trashcan&hellip; Regardless, we sent you a card because we love you, are grateful for you and value our relationship with you. If you&rsquo;ve made it this far, thanks for reading along!</p><p>Welcome to our Standridge Family one-time-newsletter. We want to share how God has been good to us this past year. Like everyone else, we&rsquo;ve had ups and there have been downs. Since Solo was born, it&rsquo;s been a rollercoaster. That little 23-month-old keeps us on our toes, but he&rsquo;s also our biggest cuddle bug. Lily is a clone of her mother. If you don&rsquo;t follow the routine&mdash;as she sees it&mdash;she WILL tell you. And honestly, we&rsquo;re proud of that.</p><p>This year has consisted of some vocational change &ndash; Callie started working part-time at Church on the Move. It&rsquo;s been a blessing to our family and she&rsquo;s enjoyed having another opportunity to use her gifts. We are also thankful for both of the kids being enrolled in the Guts Early Learning Program. This has been an additional blessing as it&rsquo;s allowed Callie to work, while also giving our kids a safe, Godly environment to learn, have fun, and grow.</p><p>Alongside that, Callie has been seeing a functional medicine doctor for about 18 months, trying to identify the root of some health issues that she&rsquo;s had for about a decade. The last year and a half had been at times very difficult &ndash; tests and treatments would leave us confused, frustrated and discouraged. Callie has, in so many ways, flipped her lifestyle upside down, but particularly in following a strict diet and avoiding any inflammatory food. It&rsquo;s been difficult amidst having toddlers, and when the hoped-for change doesn&rsquo;t seem to lead to any healing, we&rsquo;ve been left rather hopeless.</p><p>But God. He came through and showed His care over her at the end of October when Callie went in for an appointment. She was on the verge of moving on from this doctor, but instead, felt lead to pray specifically over this visit. We prayed for two things:</p><ol><li>That she would get THE answer &ndash; that there would be no confusion around what&rsquo;s going on physically in her body.</li><li>That the treatment (plan) would be conducive to our life as a family</li></ol><p>God showed up at that appointment when Callie&rsquo;s doctor walked in and said they&rsquo;d found the answer for why she&rsquo;d been feeling so badly. And the prescribed treatment plan to resolve it is incredibly easy! No impossible lifestyle changes, and she&rsquo;s able to splurge a little on some foods throughout the holidays without feeling crummy afterwards. Callie came home glowing after the appointment because she knew God had answered her prayer. We&rsquo;ll spare the specifics here, but ask if you&rsquo;re curious!</p><p>The summer started off with a week in Lake Tahoe as Grant&rsquo;s sister got married to the love of her life (cheers to Josh & Kendall!) Following that, Solo took his first steps, and Lily learned how to swim. We will see if she still remembers how to come next June though. Grant had, in August, the BEST Mountain Men trip he&rsquo;s been on.</p><p>Callie started COTMU in August &ndash; a 30-week long class at our church that, in our church&rsquo;s terms ‚Äúlays a theological foundation for discipleship to Jesus‚Äù. It has helped her view the Bible a totally different way by her not just reading it, but digesting its true meaning, background, history, etc. And we have a pretty cool brother-in-law who happens to be the teacher!</p><p>It&rsquo;s been an awesome year and we&rsquo;re thankful for how God has led our steps along the way. Looking forward to 2024, and pray you see God&rsquo;s goodness in your lives too.</p><p>‚ÄúMay the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of His Holy Spirit.‚Äù - Romans 15:13 (NIV)</p><p>If you're interested in seeing some <em>additional</em> pictures&mdash;that didn&rsquo;t make the cut for the physical card&mdash;<span>tap</span> the button below!<button id='slideshow-btn'>Open Gallery</button></p>
